# Define a set

# Sets are mutable. They can be modified by adding or removing elements.
# Example:
my_set.add(4)  # Adding an element to the set
print("Updated set after adding 4:", my_set)

# Define a set with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5

# Print the set and its type
print("Set:", new_set)

# Update the set with new string items "apple" and "banana"
new_set.update({"apple", "banana"})

# Perform set operations

# Set union

# Set intersection

# Set difference
